	<h1>6/13</h1>

			Woke up at 8. Took MRT to Beimen (transfer at Guting) and met Chia-Wei there at 9. Took us about 30 minutes to actually find the venue. When we arrived, we got cool packets and lanyards. Met Hung Lo, the delegate whose English is very good. Competed a bit and had to judge two blindfolded solves.During blindfolded, the room was very empty because of lunch, but the people who were still there were extremely quiet. Two kids asked me to help them fix their popped 4x4. Chia Wei and I picked up lunch at McDonalds closeby. In the 2nd round of 3x3, I was very nervous I wouldn't make the finals, something I never feel at US competitions. I didn't even make the 2nd rounds of 4x4 and 5x5 - people here were so fast. I did manage to get 3rd in 2x2 with a nice 1.79 single though, and 3rd in skewb. And first in BLD with a 47.22. Won some very cool medals. 

			Afterwards, Sam, Alvin, Sam's cousin William and I met with another one of Sam's cousins, Benson, and two of his friends - Josh and Jackie. We went to a newly opened mall (it's actually still unfinished!) called Syntrend. It focuses almost solely on technology and was AWESOME. There were 7 floors we could access, as floors 8-12 were still being constructed. Each floor has a different focus. The gaming floor was very cool; there were gaming laptops and desktops setup for anyone to play on (League, DotA, CS:GO, etc). For dinner we ate noodle cakes(?) with sauce and meat. Very delicious. Also had more boba. Other floors had technology stores with mechanical keyboards, laptops with projectors built-in, the latest phones, driving simulators, etc. My favorite was the headphones. Listening to some (specifically the Beats, surprisingly) were surreal. Eventually took MRT home and played some poker.

			Again had more Donut King for breakfast. Checked out of the hotel at 11 am to go to the high speed rail station which was very large. The trip was from 1:00-3:00 and cost $56 USD. Upon arrival, we played ping pong at the apartment. We had KFC for dinner. Back at the apartment, we saw a big bug flying around but eventually it hid/left. We still do not know where it went. UPDATE: we found it cerca 6:24 pm. Ran inside to the "safe-room" screaming. Ethan eventually took the iniative and captured it.

			Breakfast again was Donut King. Then we went to a buffet at the Kaohsiung Stadium which is just a mall. It had a ton of really great food including sushi, pizza, ice cream, and much more stuff that I simply do not know the name to. After that, we met up with Ethan's dad's friend who brought us to ___. There we had another fruit bowl; it was ginormous. Then we went to the British Consulate. We had to climb some stairs to get there. We had rose te and an assortment of pastries. Pretty yummy. We also got to watch the sunset from there. Finally, we took a short tour of the British Consulate. After we got some quick food at a pub. We also bychance talked to some international students who were born in LA but raised in Taiwan.

	<h1>6/10</h1>

			Ate breakfast at Donut King, pre-paid through hotel. (which did not donuts). Also had 7/11 food - iced tea, skewers, and "tea eggs." Then went to the Zuoying District via Metro to see the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas (100 stairs high each). Ate dinner at a very high class hot-pot restaurant with Ethan's dad's friend. Did laundry from 10:30-12:00. Did exceptionally in poker. Also played Settlers of Catan.

	<h1>6/9</h1>
		<p>
			Took train to Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan. It's very far south. Ate Mos Burger (100 NTD). Left at 1:20, arrived around 4. Took taxi to 85 Sky Tower, our hotel. Met with Cindy and went to ___. Ate Mexican food and had mango ice cream special for dessert. Then walked around at a very large night market with lots of carnival games.

	<h1>6/8</h1>
		<p>
			Took BRT (free bus) to a university. Saw students playing basketball, badminton, and dancing. Had a mango smoothie at the food court. Played basketball ourselves. We also had duck soup at a hole in wall. Took BRT to one of the biggest night markets there is. Had a huge variety of food - a lemonade drink, the best rib eye ever ($100), shrimp in an egg, squid, fried stinky tofu. Then did one of the most exhilarating things ever: we rode "U-Bikes" back to our hotel. For only $10 (NRT) every 30 minutes, you can rent a cool looking bike. We rode right on the streets; it was very dangerous, but an experience I shall never forget.
 	<h1>6/7</h1>
 		<p>
 			Took TRA (train) to Taichung. About 2.25 hours (12:00-2:15). Bought food on the bus - a cool box containing pork, rice, vegetables, etc. Checked in and dropped our stuff off at the hotel. The hotel is in the middle of downtown Taichung, so after we checked in, we walked around and tried various food from the street vendors. Got duck parts (feet, heart, tendons, head), mango ice, frog eggs, various meats, lemon chicken, and of course, more boba. I also got to conduct a Chinese high school orchestra playing Pirates of the Caribbbean.
 		</p>

  	<h1>6/6</h1>
 		<p>
 			Went to a place called Ximending. It was comparable to Tokyo and Times Square: bustling with shoppers, bright signs, and street performers (a really cool yo-yo guy, a harpist, a guy blowing very large bubbles). Started off with some potstickers. (14 for 50 NTD). Sam, Ethan, Andrew, and Travis all got haircuts for 350 NTD each. Ate bbq and copper pot at a Korean place. Ate dinner at an apparently famous place called "Duck" where there were only three dishes: goose tendons, goose meat (900 NTD, but still pretty good), and goose soup (only 50 NTD, very good!). Dessert was Mini Melts (Dippin' Dots). Had boba. I also learned how to play poker.

	<h1>6/5</h1>
 		<p>
 			Ate bread from a bakery for breakfast. We visited the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial and saw the changing of the guards! This took place in front of the giant statue which is above Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial. Very intense and cool. Forgot to eat lunch... Went swimming at the apartment with Sam's cousins. Also went into the sauna and steam room. Went out to dinner with Sam's cousins at Pizza Hut (buffet). Went to the Yongan night market again. Had some skewers. Got boba.

 			Ethan's cousin showed us around again. MRT to a day market (tamsui). Ethan got a super tall ice cream.  Lunch was at some hole in the wall. Boat ride to an island called Bali. On Bali, we rode two bike/carts for an hour around the island. Went to a candy store. Took boat back. Saw a Turkish ice cream guy doing his tricks. Ate dinner at a rotating sushi dish place - 48 dishes. $1 US per dish. Best dishes were these Mexican ones and this dessert - a mango jelly.

 	<h1>6/3</h1>
		<p>
			Watched Pitch Perfect 2 in our apartment. Went to Taipei 101 mall, ate at a dumpling place (apparently very famous -din tai fung). Went to top of Taipei 101, even outdoors. Ride up was less than 30 seconds. Tried to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded on the elevator ride down. Ate at none other than Pepper Lunch! (still at Taipei 101 mall). Got boba. Went to another night market (Tonghua). Also stumbled upon a walkin bus thing.

			Arrived at Haneda at 11 pm. Walked for about 11 hours (started at 1 am ended at 1 pm) trying to get to Shinjuku. Saw bats. Sang songs. Walked all the way through the sunrise. First stop was Family Mart. Got some drinks and snacks. Met a random dude. Ate breakfast - raw fish, fried sardines, soup thing in a crab shell at approximately 6:30. Used McDonalds wifi. Eventually we realized we barely got anywhere so we took a train to Shinjuku. Had Starbucks, still overpriced. Saw the Green Building, Cocoon Tower. Stopped off at a park. Ate ramen at a place where the ordering was done via machine. Went into the department store where we bought some gifts. Took train back to Haneda. Took train to Narita. Plane to Taipei!
