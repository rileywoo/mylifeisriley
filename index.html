	<h1>5/29</h1>
		<p>
			The journey begins. Got lots of extra airplane food. I rewatched s1 of Silicon Valley.
		</p>
	<h1>5/30 - 5/31</h1>
		<p>
			Arrived at Haneda at 11 pm. Walked for about 11 hours (started at 1 am ended at 1 pm) trying to get to Shinjuku. Saw bats. Sang songs. Walked all the way through the sunrise. First stop was Family Mart. Got some drinks and snacks. Met a random dude. Ate breakfast - raw fish, fried sardines, soup thing in a crab shell at approximately 6:30. Used McDonalds wifi. Eventually we realized we barely got anywhere so we took a train to Shinjuku. Had Starbucks, still overpriced. Saw the Green Building, Cocoon Tower. Stopped off at a park. Ate ramen at a place where the ordering was done via machine. Went into the department store where we bought some gifts. Took train back to Haneda. Took train to Narita. Plane to Taipei! I slept the whole way. Pretty humid once we got there. Sam's uncle showed us our accommodations, we ate dinner.

	<h1>6/1</h1>

			Played Monopoly. Watched Silicon valley s2e8. Breakfast: coffee + filled bread? Met Ethan's cousin who gave us a tour -> Took MRT from nanshijiao (our living space) to Central Station. Went to a mall at the station. Bought a cube for 120 ntd. Ate noodle soup. Took a bus. Went to the walmart type place to buy towels, etc. Went to a night market - had fried chicken, octopus in a ball(?), pony game ride, curry at a sitdown restaurant. MRT back to home.

	<h1>6/2</h1>

			Breakfast = takeout from a place only 2 minutes away. Went to zoo via MRT, saw tons of animals including 2 pandas. Not affiliated with the zoo were some caterpillars, a big spider, and a lizard. Ate dinner with Ethan's uncle + grandma at a shabu shabu place.
		</p>
	<h1>6/3</h1>
		<p>
			Watched Pitch Perfect 2 in our apartment. Went to Taipei 101 mall, ate at a dumpling place (apparently very famous -din tai fung). Went to top of Taipei 101, even outdoors. Ride up was less than 30 seconds. Tried to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded on the elevator ride down. Ate at none other than Pepper Lunch! (still at Taipei 101 mall). Got boba. Went to another night market (Tonghua). Also stumbled upon a walkin bus thing.

	<h1>6/4</h1>
 		<p>
 			Ethan's cousin showed us around again. MRT to a day market (tamsui). Ethan got a super tall ice cream.  Lunch was at some hole in the wall. Boat ride to an island called Bali. On Bali, we rode two bike/carts for an hour around the island. Went to a candy store. Took boat back. Saw a Turkish ice cream guy doing his tricks. Ate dinner at a rotating sushi dish place - 48 dishes. $1 US per dish. Best dishes were these Mexican ones and this dessert - a mango jelly.
